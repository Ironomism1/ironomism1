## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a creator who loves combining **software, hardware, and intelligence** into systems that actually *feel alive*.  
Currently, I’m mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms** and developing advanced **LLM-based AI projects** while exploring creative tools like **Blender** and **media editing**.  

I believe real innovation comes from curiosity, collaboration, and execution — from hackathons to solo experiments, I’m always learning, building, and refining.
